**Iris** is a Full-Stack Engineer, with experience in building services and websites in multiple languages. My language of choice is Rust, with various levels of compatence working in JavaScript, React/Redux, Python, HTML5, and CSS3. My preference is working on backend technologies and frameworks, particularly ones that communicate with frontend applications, utilizing a combination of Server Side Rendering (ssr), and Client Side Rendering (csr).

**Presently** the technology that has been my focus is around the developing field of WebAssembly, particularly in Rust. It's an exciting new realm of preformant and interconnection between server side and client side applications that wasn't possible to the same degree of cohensiveness.
